# etch-a-sketch

A digital pseudo-etch-a-sketch, with additional functionality to change the grid resolution, disable drawing, change the drawing color, darken pixels through multiple passovers, and draw with random colors.

Note to self: push repository to github more frequently.  Corruption of the local repository caused git to fail.  The most current files were intact and could simply be placed in a freshly cloned repository, such that no final versions were lost, but some intermediate local-only commits were lost.
